# AeroGuard Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-10-12

This Privacy Policy explains how AeroGuard ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use the AeroGuard mobile application (the "App"). Please read this policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this Policy.

If you have questions or requests about this Policy, please contact us at: support@yourcompany.com

Note: If your app’s target audience includes children under 13 or is directed to children, additional requirements apply (e.g., COPPA). See "Children’s Privacy" below and update this policy and your data practices accordingly.

## Information We Collect

We collect the following categories of information:

1) Information You Provide
- Account information: email address and authentication information if you sign in (email/password, Google, or anonymous sign-in via Firebase).
- Optional profile details: preferences and health-related sensitivities (e.g., respiratory conditions) you may choose to store to improve route safety suggestions.

2) Location Information
- Precise location (GPS, Wi‑Fi, cellular) to center the map, display your position, and provide AQI-aware routing.
- We request foreground location permission. The App does not request background location unless explicitly enabled later.

3) Device and App Information
- Device model, OS, app version, language, approximate region.
- Diagnostic logs and crash reports.

4) Usage Information
- In‑app interactions such as opening the map, tapping controls, and route selections.

5) Identifiers for Notifications
- Push notification token/identifier to deliver optional alerts (if you enable notifications).

6) Third‑Party Services
- We integrate third-party services that may receive certain data to operate their features:
  - Firebase (Authentication, Database): processes account data and may store app data.
  - Google Maps Platform / react‑native‑maps: map tiles, geocoding, routing (as applicable).
  - Expo Services (Notifications, OTA updates): delivers notifications and app updates.
  Please refer to their privacy policies for details:
  - Firebase: https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
  - Google: https://policies.google.com/privacy
  - Expo: https://expo.dev/privacy

## How We Use Your Information
- Provide, maintain, and improve App functionality (maps, AQI-aware routing, location features).
- Authenticate users and personalize content (e.g., health-aware route suggestions if you opt in).
- Send optional notifications (e.g., alerts) if enabled.
- Monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, detect/prevent abuse, and ensure security.
- Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.

## Legal Bases (where applicable)
Depending on your region (e.g., EEA/UK), we process data based on: consent (e.g., location, notifications), contract (to provide the App), legitimate interests (security, improvement), and legal obligations.

## Sharing of Information
We do not sell your personal information. We may share:
- With service providers (Firebase, Google, Expo) to operate core features and infrastructure.
- For legal reasons: to comply with laws, respond to lawful requests, or protect rights, property, users, or the public.
- As part of a business transfer (e.g., merger, acquisition), subject to this Policy.

## Data Retention
We retain information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. You can request deletion as described below.

## Your Choices and Rights
- Location: You can allow/deny location in your device settings. Without location, the App can still function with limited features (e.g., defaulting to Colombo for map centering).
- Notifications: You can enable/disable notifications in the App or device settings.
- Access/Correction/Deletion: You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data. Contact: support@yourcompany.com
- Opt‑out of Analytics/Tracking (if implemented): Follow in-app options or device settings.

## Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us to delete it. If your target audience includes children, you must update this section and ensure all data practices are COPPA‑compliant (e.g., verifiable parental consent, limited data collection).

## Security
We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## International Data Transfers
We may process your data in countries other than your own (e.g., where our providers operate). We implement appropriate safeguards as required by law.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated Policy with a new Effective date. Your continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance.

## Contact Us
If you have any questions, requests, or complaints, contact: support@yourcompany.com
